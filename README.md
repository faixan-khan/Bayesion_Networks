# Bayes-Networks
This is the modelling of the shopping Bayes' network showing belief nets in action.

# Problem Statement
We all love shopping, don’t we!? Be it for parties, weddings, formal wear, casual wear, we all
love to shop! But what decides the clothes we buy? The shop/mall, the type of dress/accessories?
There are numerous things that go through our minds when we decide to buy a simple dress!
Your job is to model this into a Bayesian net, involving all possible things that go through your
mind when you decide to buy something, and give conditional probabilities for the same, and
justify the distribution.

# Deliverables
1. A diagram of the Bayes’ net.
2. Conditional Probability Tables for all dependencies.
3. A justification behind the reasons for your choosing different probabilities for different
nodes.
4. A solved query of the form P (X | p(X), p(p(X)) ) where p(X) is the parent of node X.
